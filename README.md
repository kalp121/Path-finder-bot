# Path Finder Robot

###### Introduction
In a square grid full of obstacles at random places a robot tries to find an optimal path to reach the goal state.

-This script is written for ROS environment using catkin workspace.
-Due to high number of dependancies along folder structure I have uploaded
 Only python script which contains four algorithms for finding an optimal 
 path to reach the goal state.
-report.pdf shows comparision of the script runtime between diiferent algorithms 
 and different Heuristics.
